# Emotional_Analysis_through_NLP
Emotional Analysis through NLP is a project that utilizes pipelines to perform sentiment analysis and extract emotional insights from text data. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify text into different emotional categories.
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to detect emotions in text using machine learning. By leveraging various models, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the application can accurately classify text into several emotional categories such as anger, joy, sadness, and more. The models are trained on a labeled dataset and utilize CountVectorizer for text vectorization. The best-performing model is then deployed in a user-friendly interface that allows users to input text and receive real-time emotion predictions. The application not only provides the predicted emotion but also displays the confidence levels of all possible emotions through interactive bar charts. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development to create a practical tool for emotion detection in text, useful for applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback evaluation, and more.
